The Universal Automation Dashboard provides a peek into the system. You'll be able to see running, scheduled, and historical scripts. Universal Automation Desktop uses the same user interface with some adjustments for desktop users.

If there is pipeline output, you'll be able to see the objects on the pipeline output tab. If the pipeline output is an object, you can expand that output's properties.

If you want to view the details of a particular script, you can use the scripts tab. You will be able to edit the script, script properties and schedule directly in the UI.
