# Getting Started

## Installing Universal Automation

The installation of Universal Automation can be accomplished by merely installing Universal Automation from the PowerShell Gallery. Installing Universal Automation from the PowerShell Gallery can be accomplished by using `Install-Module` PowerShell Command. The Universal Automation module comes in 3 variants:

* UniversalAutomation - Includes the Universal Automation agent and cmdlets. 
* UniversalAutomation.Dashboard - Starts just Universal Dashboard for Universal Automation \(for those who wish to separate their dashboard host from their Universal Automation host.

To install the agent and cmdlets, install UniversalAutomation.

```text
Install-Module -Name UniversalAutomation
```

To install the Universal Automation Dashboard, install the `UniversalAutomation.Dashboard` module.

```text
Install-Module -Name UniversalAutomation.Dashboard
```

## Starting Universal Automation

First, we'll Import the Universal Automation PowerShell Module and the Universal Automation Dashboard Module.

```text
Import-Module "UniversalAutomation.psd1"
Import-Module "UniversalAutomation.Dashboard.psd1"
```

Once imported, we need to take a number of steps to Start and connector to our Universal Automation Instance.

1. Start the Universal Automation Server
2. Connect our PowerShell Terminal to the Universal Automation Server

```text
$AppToken = Start-UAServer -Port 10000
Connect-UAServer -ComputerName "http://localhost:10000" -AppToken $AppToken
```

Once connected, we'll immediately be able to execute commands against our Universal Automation Instance.

Optionally, if the Dashboard component of Universal Automation is installed, we can initiate the Dashboard component with the following commands:

```text
$Dashboard = New-UADashboard
Start-UDDashboard -Dashboard $Dashboard -Port 10001
```

At this point we'll have our Universal Automation server started and ready to receive commands.
